Watson Assistant Utilities
==========================

This is a suite of utilities that work with IBM’s [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-assistant/) (formerly the Watson Conversation Service). It’s available as a hosted service at https://neatnik.net/watson/assistant/utilities/, or you can download this source code and run the service on your own server.

Previously, these utilities were available as standalone scripts. They're being moved into this new single service for simplicity and convenience.
